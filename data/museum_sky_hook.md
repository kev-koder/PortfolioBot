# Project: The Guggenheim "Sky-Hook" Addition

## 1. Project Overview
As the Lead Architect for the **Vandelay Design Group**, I was tasked with expanding the Guggenheim Museum without actually using any ground space. My solution was the **"Sky-Hook" Expansion**, a floating wing of the museum suspended 500 feet in the air using proprietary electromagnetic latex cables.



## 2. Technical Challenge: The Gravity Problem
Traditional architecture relies heavily on "the ground." I found this limitation to be artistically stifling. The challenge was to keep 40,000 tons of concrete and Picassos hovering stably above Manhattan during high-wind events.

### The Solution: "Elastic Tensioning"
We utilized 400 custom-fabricated **Vandelay Industrial Latex Cables**. These cables have a tensile strength 10x higher than steel but remain flexible enough to "bounce" during thunderstorms, providing a built-in amusement park experience for museum patrons.

## 3. Engineering Stack
* **Structural Logic:** Python 3.13 (running real-time wind-resistance simulations)
* **Materials:** Liquid-Crystal Latex, Anti-Gravity Shims, and Grade-A Stucco
* **Safety Protocol:** The "Big Net" System

## 4. Key Features

### The Rotating Rotunda
To ensure every piece of art gets equal sunlight, I programmed the entire expansion to rotate 360 degrees every hour.
```python
def adjust_rotation(wind_speed, sun_angle):
    # If it's too windy, we slow down to prevent motion sickness
    if wind_speed > 50:
        return "Locking rotation gears."
    else:
        return f"Rotating to {sun_angle} degrees."
